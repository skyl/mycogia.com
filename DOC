I added olwidget by putting it into ./apps/

pyfacebook and django-facebookconnect I used setup.py in the pinax-env
I think that perhaps I should ship these with the apps and keep all changes outside of the env
and what the boot script does.  This way I can try to upgrade pinax and get only my over-rides from
myApp (but get all of them).

RESOLUTION: I am using setup.py in the v-env but putting the apps under ./ext/ to "ship" with them ready to set-up for now
